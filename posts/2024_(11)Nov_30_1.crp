T=>Identify changer<=T
" Haii! "
" I have seen a lot of rises and falls in the internet. I am gonna talk about those people who changes their identity like playing cards. "
" Of course it's like being in wild west of the internet, about golden times, when only wizards would know about changing their identity. We have static IP addresses - servers (ivan-krul.github.io), and we have dynamic IP addresses - client (browser). If there was no static IP addresses, there will not even turn the internet we know. These people think they are not static, like liquid or gas. But eventually big corporation would conquer the internet for a very long time. "
" You can argue, that the dynamic appearance would make the internet more private and safer, than should we go back to roots and try out the rejected gopher protocol instead of http, where u can not use any tools of web but text and links? Well, then if you still insisting to have dynamic appearance, then good luck to do this in real life. "
" That all what I am thinking about "
" Byeeee! "
