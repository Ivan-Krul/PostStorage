T=>I don't know what can I describe that :P<=T

You know guys, despite I have a lot of friends in the internet, eventually I would end up only with myself.
I don't know, recently something took my will to do anything and decided to go generate some ideas while suffering in boredom.
All that care I would need to supply happiness for you is lacking now, or it's just like May, where all that progress would go downwards. Maybe I should finally go sleep. !|

Tho, it's not vent, venting is bad.
Everyone can be depressed from venting, wanting theirs would to drain them whole.
Because venting is harmful for everyone, it's considering bad, so ye.!|
Good night!
