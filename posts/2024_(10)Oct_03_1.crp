T=>I like rain in October<=T
" Heyoo! I'm starting to write posts in wild topics. Why I like rains in October? "
" Well, we have to talk about the another topic - seasons. We know we're dealing with global warming, and it's sucks. I used to like winter because of snow and holidays and activity, etc. Now the snow reason would be more rare, than mud, or rain instead of snowing, so it's not the best season, despite I was born in February. Spring is also good season with blossoming of flowers and cherry or apple, apricot. *"It's going to shine!"* - spelling me till today, because it's inspiring aura of upcomming summer is a whole pleasure. Summer is not so good. It's too hot :p. I hate summers with lack of activities, because you waited for it from the spring just to sit and boil your head in 33Â°C. And now we got autumn. It's getting cold and like spring has an aura of upcomming winter, at least it's holidays. Why do I like rain in October? Because it has such a vibe, when u hear the rain outside, and see yellow or orange leaves, you imediately want to focus on an inspiration. "
" Well, that's it folks, cya in next post! "
