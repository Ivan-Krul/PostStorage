# #23 - #34 Weeks: A lots of trips and nimby

Insane!
Hai tho!

I really didn't touch the PostViewer for a looong time.
Mainly because from one side I was so well distracted to not write posts,
and from other side to getting constantly tired (still not a justification).
I got hooked into another game you would wish to not touch. It's called "NIMBY Rails".

My the most advanced save is impressive. Later in next posts I will tell you about my trips!
Right now byeee!
